How does speech recognition work!

Speech recognition starts by taking the sound energy produced by the person speaking and converting it into electrical energy with the help of a microphone. 
It then converts this electrical energy from analog to digital, and finally to text. 

It breaks the audio data down into sounds, and it analyzes the sounds using algorithms to find the most probable word that fits that audio. 
All of this is done using Natural Language Processing and Neural Networks.
